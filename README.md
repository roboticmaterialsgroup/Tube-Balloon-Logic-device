# Tube-Balloon Logic for the Exploration of Fluidic Control Elements

INSTRUCTION MANUAL

Overview of Materials:
- Flexible PVC tubing
- Balloon
- Straws
- Scissor
- Hole puncher
- Parafilm tape
- Scale
- Marker



Fabrication of Tube Balloon Logic (TBL) device:
1. Mark the straws(diameter of 12.7 mm) at 40 mm pieces and cut it into two  pieces. 
2. Fold   one piece of the straw in the middle to create a bendable layer (with a heart-like shape)
3. Insert the bendable layer into the outer straw
4. Punch holes into both straws as an inlet for the PVC tubing using a hole puncher
5. Cut the flexible PVC tubing(inner diameter of 1 mm) into two pieces of ~7.5 cm in length 
6. Feed a  one piece of PVC tubing  through both straws (bendable layer and outer straw)
7. Cut the balloon to 20 cm length, pushed it over the other piece of  tubing with an overlap of 1 cm 
8. Use Parafilm to seal the balloon to the tubing. 
9. Insert the balloon inside the outer straw such that it lays in between the outer straw and the bendable straw layer 
10. Use Parafilm to fix the tubing to the straw.
11. Seal another end of the staws to ensure balloon cannot overinflate 
12. Congradulations, you have successfully fabricated TBL device
13. Now your device is ready for testing!
